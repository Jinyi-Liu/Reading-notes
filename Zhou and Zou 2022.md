# Zhou and Zou (2022) Marketing Science

## Background
- What was the context for this research? 
  - Many marketplaces’ recommendation systems prioritize recommending products that lead to the highest expected commission for each recommendation.
  - Anecdotes suggest that third-party sellers realize that their prices can influence the marketplace’s recommendations.

<!-- - What has been studied or determined already? -->



## Research Questions
1. How will the marketplace’s recommendation system influence the **competition** between third-party sellers and subsequently the payoffs of the marketplace, third-party sellers, and consumers?
2. Will **maximizing** the profit of **each recommendation** necessarily maximize the marketplace’s **total profit**? If not, how should the marketplace design its recommendation system? 
3. How will the marketplace’s **ability to predict** consumers’ preferences change the market outcome? Can the marketplace overtarget its customers?
4. How will the answers to these questions change if the marketplace has a **consumer-surplus** orientation instead of a profit orientation?

## Model and Assumptions
- Analytical framework
  - Two **thirdparty sellers** offer horizontally differentiated products in an online marketplace and simultaneously set their prices. 
  - The **marketplace** charges the sellers a percentage commission and recommends one and only one product to each of its customers.
  - Different **consumers**, based on the **marketplace’s knowledge** about their **preferences** about the two products, can receive different product recommendations.
    -  For each consumer, the marketplace receives a noisy signal about her preferences for the two products, and the signal’s precision reflects the marketplace’s consumer profiling accuracy.
    -  Consumers also differ in their information about the products’ existence.
       -  (1-k) Informed consumers know both products’ existence even without product recommendations.
       -  (k) Uninformed consumers will know a product’s existence only via the marketplace’s recommendation.
- Consumer $i$'s utility:
  $$u_i=(\alpha+t_i)q_{iA}+(\alpha-t_i)q_{iB}-\frac{\beta}{2}(q_{iA}^2+q_{iB}^2+2z q_{iA}q_{iB})-p_A q_{iA}-p_B q_{iB}.$$


## Methods
<!-- - What was the objective? -->
<!-- - How did the authors collect data? -->
<!-- - When and where did the research take place? -->



## Key Findings
<!-- - What highlights emerged? -->
<!-- - Were there any surprises? -->
1.  A seller has a “**recommendation-competition**” incentive when setting its price to gain the marketplace’s recommendations to more consumers. The “**value-exploitation**” incentive drives the seller to set a high price. The “**price-undercutting**” incentive motivates the seller to choose a low price to compete directly with its rival for the informed consumers. The equilibrium price under the profitbased recommendation system will be **jointly** determined by **these three incentives**.
2. Under the profit-based recommendation system, the equilibrium price first decreases and then increases in the marketplace’s consumer profiling accuracy.
3. The marketplace may increase its profit by adopting the price-neutral recommendation system.
4.

## My Thoughts & Questions
1. A market place could be a reseller itself, which competes with the third-party retailers. Proposition 3 may not be hold in this case.
2. How about disengagement?
3. Is the assumption that $k>f(z)$ really resonable?
