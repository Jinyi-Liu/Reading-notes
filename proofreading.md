## Appendix B
### B1. Reseller Model
#### Case NN
The fifth paragraph, $p_r=\frac{3a}{4}(a+\gamma\tilde p_{or})$ should be $p_r=\frac{3}{4}(a+\gamma\tilde p_{or})$
<!-- 
I think that the online platform having the demand signal is a common knowledge. Why the manufacturer conjectures her profit from the platform is $w_0(a+E(\theta)-p_o+\gamma\tilde p_{ro})$ but not something like $w_o(a+\tilde{f}(Y)-p_o+\gamma\tilde{p}_{ro})$, albeit we can assume that since the manufacturer has no knowledge of $Y$, $E_m[\tilde{f}(Y)]=0$. -->
